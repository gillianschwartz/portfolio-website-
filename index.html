            <p>My first project is a video essay about the legacy of Ringo Starr, and his contribution to the Beatles. I argue that the Beatles would not have stayed afloat without Ringo. Give it a watch!</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p> Throughout this semester, this class has strengthed my ability to digitally compose media in a number of forms. I learned how to utilize different softwares and applications like Audacity, Premier Pro, and visual studio code. I had no experience using any of these applications, so it seemed a bit daunting intially. However, now that i have my bearings, I feel that my digital communication has improved significantly. In this digigtal age, these resources will help me supplement both my academic, career, and personal endeavors.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While all the project displayed on this website brought challenges, using Visual Studio Code to create this website was by the far the hardest. As someone who has never coded in this style before, this language was completely foreign to me. Learning all the different elements, how to utilize them, and where to put them on each html page is an intricate process. However, nothing was more satisfying then when I got the hang out it. 
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Once I achieved the basics of HTML, there was an unlimited of customizations and styles to be added. The combinations are truly endless. Using a style.css file to create the perfect formation of my website was my favorite part. I chose a simple style with pops of dark purple to make certain elements stand out, like the buttons. Although my website is simple, there are a lot of elements and attributes that contribute to this. 
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        We live in a digitized world, where things like websites, audio narratives, and video essays can reach audiences all over the world. Learning how to compose these allows me not only be creative in the way I share information, but share it to a group of people that was not possible only 20 years ago.
