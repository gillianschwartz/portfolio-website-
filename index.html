            <sub>This website serves as a porfolio, cultivating my projects from this semester in "Composing Digital Media". Making this website also serves as a project, where I learned to code in html. Learning how to communicate digitally in an effective way is the future, and I loved learning how to navigate different platforms.</sub>
            <p>My first project is a video essay about the legacy of Ringo Starr, and his contribution to the Beatles. I argue that the Beatles would not have stayed afloat without Ringo. Give it a watch! </p>

                <p>My second project is an audio narrative that dives deeper into the imfamous Zodiac Killer. By analyzing ciphers and pulling theories together, mysteries of the Zodiac are uncovered.</p>
