<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Zodiac "deciphering ciphers"
In this audio narrative, I am diving into the ciphers that the Zodiac killer wrote and sent to multiple news agencies. In these letters, he claimed responsibility for a number of murders, as well as taunted police authorities, and expressed anger with their choices on the case. The most notable parts of these letters were the symbols that the zodiac arranged in a specific pattern, trying to assert dominance over authorities as they scratched their heads at these compelling symbols. The most famous cipher is what I'll be investigating in this audio narrative, aka the 308 word cipher. 
My rhetorical purpose was to analyze how the killer used coded messages to instill fear, maintain control over the narrative, and challenge both the authorities and the public. By breaking down the psychological motivations behind these ciphers, I aimed to provide a fresh perspective on the case while engaging listeners with both historical and analytical insights.

<p>I used the podcast format to create a suspenseful and engaging atmosphere in designing my audio narrative. Through editing in Audacity, I structured the podcast to build tension, starting with the mystery of the ciphers and then exploring the linguistic and mathematical techniques used to decode them. I also incorporated sound effects and pacing techniques to enhance immersion, making the listener feel as if they were unraveling the mystery alongside the cryptographers who worked to decode the Zodiac’s messages. This approach allowed me to balance storytelling with analysis, making complex cryptographic concepts more accessible to my audience.

Throughout this process, I engaged with topics about true crime, cryptography, and forensic psychology. I referenced expert analyses, historical accounts, and recent breakthroughs in cipher decryption to ensure up-to-date information. Researching different theories helped me assess the Zodiac’s motives and the ever-changing interpretations of his messages. Additionally, I considered ethical concerns surrounding true crime media, ensuring my podcast remained informative rather than sensationalized.

Developing this project was challenging, especially when using new software that was unfamiliar to me. Using Audacity requires careful attention to audio layering and transitions, which is an important factor in keeping an audience engaged. Workshopping with peers was helpful, as their feedback was constructive and led me to the end goal. Early drafts lacked clarity in explaining cryptographic techniques, so I revised my script to simplify key concepts while still explaining this aspect. Overall, this project allowed me to strengthen my research, storytelling, and technical skills.</p>
